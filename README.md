# PHPStorm Codestyle

My Codestyles. Need help? Read [this](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/2016.1/directories-used-by-phpstorm-to-store-settings-caches-plugins-and-logs.html).

## JavaScript
Javascript follows the "StandardJS" config, as descriped [here](http://standardjs.com/webstorm.html).

## PHP
Nothing yet. It's still something custom between multiple codestyles.
We'll do that later when I found an proper codestyle for me.


(and when I finally do more PHP...)


### License
Do you really think on that is a license?
